# Overall Forms of Communication

This document describes the essentials of the Overall Forms of Communication in Construct-ive English Language Form ( CELF ) .

This is a sub-set of English focusing primarily Construct-ive Form of English as inclusive-ly in communication as possible .

## Brief Overview Of Forms

More forms may / will be added in time , as well as , further precisioning of existing forms of communication .

This document represents a living overview document .

## Feeling Form

Re-allocation of typical wording to have more feeling in communication , especially in writing and speech .

Examples :

Awe-some / awe-some , Excel-lent / excel-lent , EnJoyable / en-joy-able , etc.

## 'i' Form ( Also , And Always )

Particularly for use when something appears to be 'instructive' in nature .

## Present Form ( Also , And Always )

Technically , only three time periods exist :

Before Now , Now , Beyond Now .

When possible , and timely ( depending on formality of document , etc. ), conclude each word with 'ing' and/or some form of ongoing .

## 'humility form' (Also , And Always )

The Speaker should choose humility form in communication as much as possible :

' What if I receive my own message ? Will I accept this presentation more easily or a different style ? '

Often , teaching about language is to 'think of the listener' . If 'generic I' may like a different route of presentation , maybe I should be doing so as the Speaker ?

True communication is more 'Listener'-driven than usually presenting in teaching .

Let us consider also the : 'If a tree/object which makes a sound "falls in the forest" does **this make a sound** ? '

Possibly one route , among other possibilities , is , only if at least one person / Person is *listening*

Example :

'Please Speak .
i am listening
( humility form , also and always ) '

## 'Respect Form' / 'Ordering Form'

*When* :

* **Congratulating** : When something / somethings / someone / someones are to be 'congratulating' put all others first .

Example ( s ) :

'Team , thank you all . Our success depends on you all more than myself . Thank you all . "

* **Instructive** : when instructive form , Respect Form would indicate "generic I" should go first , if I am learning to receive my own feedback , why should I expect anyone else to do so ?

Example ( s ) :

' Team , should I being doing this clean up task ... I will start here ... '

* **Relation To Receiver First** ( depending when another category above may apply first , or another ) : When communicating with another , especially 1-to-1 , when possibly and timely , please considering referencing the 'Listener' primarily before all others , especially in 'Respect Form'

Example ( s ) :

' Hi , Friend , since I am speaking to you , even though one of your relative's is my more direct friend , I will address you in this form ... "

## 'Spacing' Form

When possible , allow an extra space especially in digital communication before and after lines and / or certain aspects of communication , depending on the context , possibly even before and/or after any form of punctuation / quoting / brackets , etc. .

While this may seem strange to some , this inherently builds more comfort especially for some types of readers .

Sometimes , especially in digital format , separate lines , such as how this document is being compiling / organizing , will assist readers in seeing individual points .

Examples : throughout this document . More can be added in time .

## Additional Forms of Communication / Listening / Speech / Etc.

* Additional forms to be added in / over time .

* Suggestions are always accepting and welcome ( also a present form , also and always , example )
