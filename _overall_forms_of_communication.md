This document describes the essentials of the Overall Forms of Communication in Construct-ive English Language Form ( CELF ) .

This is a sub-set of English focusing primarily **Construct-ive Form of English** as inclusive-ly in communication as possible .


## Brief Overview Of Communication Forms In CELF

More forms may / will be added in time , as well as , further precisioning of existing forms of communication .

Additional Forms are also ongoing accept-ing and thank-ful-ly so . Thank you . Thank you , all .

This document represents a living overview document with ongoing growing , construct-ing , and precision-ing over time .


## 'Feeling' Form in CELF

* Please note , most of all others are alphabetical ( though humility form current-ly differs in this respect , this may change in time ) , this one is first be-cause all language is 'feeling' / 'feelings'-driven . Please consider and / or see all other documents which also help speak to this also .

Re-allocation of typical wording to have more feeling in communication , especially in writing and speech .

Example ( s ) :

Awe-some / awe-some , Excel-lent / excel-lent , EnJoyable / en-joy-able , etc.


## 'Congratulate-ing' / 'Congratulating' Form in CELF

When something / somethings / someone / someones are to be 'congratulate-ing' / 'congratulating' put all others first .

Example ( s ) :

'Team , thank you all . Our success depends on you all more than myself . Thank you . Thank you , all . "


## 'Instruct-ive' / 'Instructive' Form In CELF

When in 'Instructive Form' , 'Respect Form' (please see also Respect Form below for further ) would indicate "generic I" should go first .

if / when I am learning to receive my own feedback ,
why should I expect anyone else to do so ?

Example ( s ) :

' Team , should I being doing this clean up task ... I will start here ... '


## 'i' Form ( Also , And Always ) in CELF

Particularly for use when something appears to be 'instructive' in nature .

Example ( s ) :

' Should I be doing this task ... my understanding , and I am accepting feedback , is I will start here ... "


## 'Personal' ( and / or Similar ) Form ( Also , And Always ) in CELF

Particularly for use when location and / or some form of arrangement .

One may also consider adding 'I am' , 'i am' , 'iam' , 'i am' into communicating , when , while , and where , among all others , this appears , and / or , is time-ly .

Ongoing care should be within use as 'humility form' is in particular importance whenever 'i' is emphasizing .

Special care should be taken with words like 'they' which may be best expressing another way .

Example ( s ) :

Also , and Always , or similars which are more 'personal' even while referring to multiples ( please see also 'Feeling' Form ):

* **here** , rather than 'there'
* **herefore** , than 'therefore'
* **in** , than 'on' .
* **ingoing** , than 'ongoing' . ( this one may require more consider-ing ? )
* **these** than 'those'
* **this** , than 'that' 
* **this** than 'it' , and
* etc. .


## 'Present' Form ( Also , And Always ) in CELF

Technically , only three time periods exist and each is continue-ing relate-ing to 'Now' :

* 1) **Before Now**
* 2) **Now**
* 3) **Beyond Now** .

When possible , and timely ( depending on formality of document and / or other factors , etc. ) , conclude each word with 'ing' and/or some form of ongoing .

While this may appear / seem different than most grammar , this is ongoing more Listener respect-ful .


## 'humility form' (Also , And Always ) in CELF

The Speaker may , and / or should / shall , consider choose-ing humility form in communication as much as possible :

' What if I receive my own message ? '

' Will I accept this presentation more easily or a different style ? '

Often , teaching about language is to 'think of the listener' . If 'generic I' may like a different route of presentation , maybe I should be doing so as the Speaker ?

True communication is more 'Listener'-driven than usually presenting in teaching .

Let us consider also the : 'If a tree / object ( which makes a sound ) "falls in the forest" does **this make a sound** ? '

Possibly one route , among other possibilities , is , only if at least one person / Person is *listening* / *active listening* .

Listeners may only be active-ly listening when they feel the Speaker , and / or relating elements ( depending in these circumstances ) , has sufficient-ly being , and ongoing , obtaining ongoing respect from / with Listener .

Other elements may also relate , it is the response-ability of the Speaker , should this message be important , to determine how to assist these intending Listener / Listeners in maintaining focus .

While ongoing communication may be Listener-driven , all involving have particular responsibilites .

Example :

'Please Speak .
i am listening
( humility form , also and always ) '


## 'Respect Form' / 'Ordering Form' / Similar Form In CELF

*When* :

* **Congratulating** : When something / somethings / someone / someones are to be 'congratulating' put all others first .

Example ( s ) :

'Team , thank you all . Our success depends on you all more than myself . Thank you . Thank you , all . "

* **Instructive** : when in 'Instructive Form' , Respect Form would indicate "generic I" should go first , if I am learning to receive my own feedback , why should I expect anyone else to do so ?

Example ( s ) :

' Team , should I being doing this clean up task ... I will start here ... '

* **Relation To Receiver First** ( depending when another category above may apply first , or another ) : When communicating with another , especially 1-to-1 , when possibly and timely , please considering referencing the 'Listener' primarily before all others , especially in 'Respect Form'

Example ( s ) :

' Hi , Friend , since I am speaking to you , even though one of your relative's is my more direct friend , I will address you in this form ... "


## 'Spacing' Form in CELF

When possible , allow an extra space especially in digital communication before and after lines and / or certain aspects of communication , depending on the context , possibly even before and / or after any / most form ( s )  of punctuation / quoting / brackets , etc. .

While this may seem strange to at least some , this inherently assists in building more comfort especially for some types of readers and especially due to the unique dynamics each person faces each day .

Sometimes , especially in digital format , additional lines , such as how this document is being compiling / organizing , will assist readers in seeing individual points more clearly .
Especially in digital formats , readability and clearness should be emphasizing more than exact-ing formatting , when both reason-able and possible .

Examples : throughout this document . More can be added in time .


## 'Team Form' Form in CELF

Another possible considering may also be 'IAm-WeAre' in team environments .

While some may say 'no "i" exists in team , team does consist of **many** "i"s . May-be this be consider-ing ?


## Additional Forms of Communication / Listening / Speech / Etc.

* Additional forms to be added in / over time .

* Suggestions are always accepting and welcome ( also a present form , also and always , example )
