## Synopsis Of CELF

The intention and purpose of this ongoing learning project is create a learning in a progress project based solely upon utilizing the construct-ive sub-set of communication in the English Language as inclusive-ly as possible .

We can also call this Constructive Inclusive-ty / Inclusivi-ty which in which form of ex intending for the mutual benefit of everyone .

## CELF - Feelings And Intentions
Here we primarily consider communication in , and through , human language in any form is driven essentially by :

* **feelings** ( "Do I and/or others feel good before , during and/or after this communication ? " ) , and

* **intentions** ( " What is my/our intention with this communication ? What is the outcome we intend to achieve ? " )


This project is deeply-rooted and based upon the understanding all human communication languages are designed inherently to encourage both the person and/or people as Speaker and Listener , as ideally as Mutual Communicators (MC) , in mutual communication , to have a construct-ive overall outcome with any , and all , communication , examples of portions are as follows :

* leading into         ( " How is this communication going to go ? ")
* during               ( " I like how I **feel** about this communication ! ") 
* conclusion           ( " Wait ? What ? We have to conclude this communication for now ? Already ? When is our next one ? ")
* and after-conclusion ( " Do I remember this communication as a construct-ive experience , other , or to , eventually ,be construct-ive experience ? " )

This is important to remember as all communication is experience and feelings base-ing .
Intentions behind this communication , which can also have more involving roots , fit together in this also .

This is also deeply-root and based upon the application of where each Communicator and/or Listener , as roles can switch often depending upon the communication form and format (for example , lecture/teaching styles differ from other forms typically ) , should feel good about what is being accomplish-ing / progress-ing and all should feel good together .

The primary intention here is utilizing construct-ive , also and always , words in the right contexts and as much as possible and / or necessary in consideration of all ongoing goals and objective-s , whether  aware , and / or learning to be , aware.

Some contexts require original words and feelings and these should be sparingly including .
This approach here looks with communication as being driven by goals / intentions / etc. and will cause feelings to ongoing change toward construct-ive or something different than construct-ive , possibly over time , and / or depending how often such communication is anticipating / expecting by one and/or both / all parties .
It is also possible construct-ive , also and always , words may seem very effective with certain types of other people , depending upon many other factors , and who may also be less commonly aware of this method of construct-ive-always communication .
Patience with everyone is also key .

This also depends deeply upon this situation and all of the related specifics of why original words are necessary .
For example , is the intention to quote someone and/or some people directly so original meaning is maintained as close as possible ?
Should this answer be yes , this may best to associate this directly as a quote , and / or a generic someone / some people unless specific names are required and/or required to be left ongoing omitting for a form of privacy protection reasons .

Example : " The Truth . The whole Truth . Only the Truth. "  ( re-phrased/course-corrected from Legal contexts )

In the examples below , please note words like **kind** are to be understood like [positive infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity) in [Math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math) and have a value so high they are unable to be calculated at all and , therefore , we center back to this same word to define and represent itself .

# Examples

**A Few Very Construct-ive Examples** :

* This feels very deeply **kind** to me . I appreciate this deeply . Thank You !
ðŸ˜€ðŸ•ŠðŸŒ…

* This feels equal to very **kind** to me . I appreciate this deeply . Thank You !
ðŸ˜€ðŸ•ŠðŸŒ…

**A Few Different Than Constructi-ve Examples** :

* This feels very **different** than **kind** to me . I feel very deeply hurt .ðŸ˜­

* This feels very other than **kind** to me . I feel very deeply hurt .ðŸ˜­

* This feels very much less than **kind** to me . I feel very deeply hurt .ðŸ˜­

**Other Construct-ive Examples** :

* Everyone helping everyone , **construct-ive-ly** , and in Truth , is Awe-some .

* Let us , please , have an Awe-some Construct-ive Day , All .
